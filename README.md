# rForest
The package rForest introduces tree-based methods as tools for analyzing high dimensional classification
problems. In particular, the package provides a basic implementation of the classification and regression
trees (CART) algorithm (where as of now, the emphasis here is put on categorial response variables, i.e. on
classification problems). In combination with bootstrap resampling, the algorithmâ€™s functionality will be
extended by Bagging to support the construction of tree ensembles or bagged trees, of which the Random
Forest algorithm is introduced as a special case.
